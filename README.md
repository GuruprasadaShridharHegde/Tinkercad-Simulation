### What is Tinkercad?
-Tinkercad is a free 3D modeling program known for its ease of use. It‚Äôs 100% web-based, making it available to anyone with an internet connection.
-Kids, educators, and hobbyists use it to design anything imaginable. Utilizing 3D printing, laser cutting, or building blocks can bring Tinkercad projects into real life.
-Many Schools use it as a way to teach projects with 3D Design, Electronics, and Visual Code Blocks.

Let‚Äôs explore these three core areas of Tinkercad.ü§î

**1) 3D Design**
Tinkercad launched in 2011 to make 3D designs available to the general public. Designing in Tinkercad is a great way to learn the foundation of solid modeling. Solid modeling is the practice of building objects with primitive shapes. Users can drag and drop premade shapes into the workspace to create solids.
By combining premade shapes, users can create their unique designs.

**2) Electronics**
Unique designs can also utilize motion and light by using Tinkercad‚Äôs built-in circuit features.Users can begin with a starter circuit or build their own by using premade wire components. Virtual-circuits are a great way to learn and tinker before making it in real life.
Built-in Code blocks or custom C++ can run circuit components. Users can tweak and further define them until they achieve their desired result.

**3) Visual Code Blocks**
Drag and drop premade code blocks together to make custom shapes. Code blocks allow the creation of 3D designs using visual programming.Reordering the code blocks can refine the details of shapes. For example, a cylinder code block cut out from a box code block makes a hole.To save time, Tinkercad includes several example code blocks. The ‚ÄúStarters‚Äù section groups all of the samples that are ready to use.Creating custom code blocks includes making changes to a code block, followed by pressing the Run button to see the changes rendered on the workspace ‚Äì it‚Äôs that easy!

### Arduino in Tinkercad
For over 15 years, the Arduino ecosystem of microcontroller boards and code libraries have become an indispensable part of electronics education. But if you‚Äôve ever worked with a student to connect an Arduino board to their computer, download Arduino‚Äôs IDE software, update the libraries, and configure the ports, you know that it can be a bumpy road.

The Arduino simulation within Tinkercad simplifies the learning experience. It‚Äôs free, works on any computer with an Internet connection, and scales to any class size. Best of all, Tinkercad Circuits provides a bottomless supply of virtual components that students can use to build and simulate their projects.

When they‚Äôre ready to physically prototype their projects, Tinkercad Circuits makes it easy to export their code as a native Arduino (.ino) file that they can upload to their board.

#### Arduino Starters
One of the fastest ways to explore the possibilities of Arduino in Tinkercad is to simply drag one of our sample Starter circuits into your workspace.
We have nearly two dozen Arduino Starter circuits to choose from. Each example includes sample code that you can view, simulate, and modify.

#### Coding Arduino in Tinkercad
Tinkercad allows you to code your Arduino using two different approaches. Our Blocks code editor offers beginners a visual system of functions that they can drag and rearrange. All of our Arduino Starters, and most of our interactive Arduino lessons will include or refer to Blocks code.

#### Debugging Arduino Code
One of the biggest challenges in learning to code is learning how to troubleshoot problems when the code isn‚Äôt working as planned. When a student‚Äôs code doesn‚Äôt work, Tinkercad‚Äôs error console will automatically pop into view. Similar to how errors are reported in the Arduino IDE, this error console will report and highlight the suspected issues that need fixing.

Tinkercad‚Äôs Arduino debugger also includes a unique and useful code break feature. By selecting lines of code, you can define moments within your code where you‚Äôd like the simulation to pause. These pauses will happen automatically during simulation, allowing students to read values and troubleshoot problems. A button above their code (shown below) resumes the simulation or advances to the next break.
